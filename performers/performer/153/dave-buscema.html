        <h2>Dave Buscema</h2>
        <p>
          Dave Buscema performs every Wednesday night with circuit team Face Card at The Queen&#39;s Secret Improv Club. He loves playing with this latest incarnation of the team formerly known as 50% Dave and doesn&#39;t miss having his name as part of the team&#39;s title since the faulty math always nagged him.
Plus, it puts Dave&#39;s number of teams he&#39;s been involved with that include the word face at two, a new point of pride. Dave, who has studied at UCB and the Magnet, was a founding member of Baby FACE, a group inspired and coached by the pioneering jazz/improv team, FACE, using jazz music to influence scenes. Dave has also enjoyed playing with indie team The Elusive Rock, a spawn of the extremely enjoyable Improv in the Park, a meeting of improvisers of all age and experience levels in parks and indoor public spaces across New York City.
