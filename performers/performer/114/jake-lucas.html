        <h2>Jake Lucas</h2>
        <p>
          Jake has been performing Improv since 2006. He has studied at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater under Ari Voukydis, Porter Mason, Shannon O&#39;Neill, Kevin Hines, Erik Tanouye, Laura Grey, and Lydia Hensler. He can be seen performing weekly at the Queens Secret Improv Club with his team Zealand, and every other Tuesday with his long-running indie team Rat King.
 This is where he would put some long, jokey bits to his biography like every other improviser, but unfortunately Jake is a nihilist.
