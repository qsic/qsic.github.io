        <h2>Rita Chinyere</h2>
        <p>
          Rita is an avid improviser based in New York City. She graduated from Rutgers University before roping through the nation on a tour of hard knocks with stints in Chicago, Washington DC and Akron, Ohio where she earned a Master&#39;s Degree which many consider pointless. She currently studies improv at the Upright Citizen&#39;s Brigade Theatre where she&#39;s been lucky enough to learn from the likes of Neil Casey, Will Hines, Chris Gethard, Brandon Scott Jones, Lydia Hensler, Abra Tabak, Tim Martin, Chelsea Clarke and Patrick Clair. Rita is a proud member of Anders &amp; Cooper, Gentleman&#39;s Agreement, Not Murderers and Cory &amp; Topanga. 
 She&#39;s from London, England and has many interesting stories. Ask her about them some time.
