        <h2>Leo Mendoza</h2>
        <p>
          Leo&#39;s been lucky enough to train with a bunch of luminaries, including TJ Jagodowski, Joe Bill, Mick Napier, Susan Messing, Michael Patrick O&#39;Brien, Jeff Griggs and Armando Diaz, and had the pleasure of improvising in Chicago, New York, and Florida. His team was once crowned the &quot;champions&quot; of &quot;Improv Gladiators&quot;, which sounds as ridiculous as it seems. In the regular theater world, he&#39;s an ensemble member with two amazing theater troupes, Tympanic Theatre Company (Chicago) and Left Hip Productions (NY) He can move both of his nostrils independently, flick playing cards across a room, and make a pen look like it&#39;s twirling around his hand when it&#39;s really not. Bios are weird, aren&#39;t they?
