        <h2>Frank Angelini</h2>
        <p>
          Frank began improvising in 2007. He has studied extensively in that time at The Magnet, UCB, and Annoyance theaters. It took him a while to become an improvisor currently self-described as &quot;a wee bit adequate&quot;. He was a member of house teams Attack Heart Attack at The Magnet Theater and Improv Nation at the former eGarage. He can currently be seen performing in his two man group, Genetic Freaks, alongside George Fernandez, as well as with Jacob&#39;s Parting Gift, and Face Off Unlimited. 
Frank is currently artistic director of The Queen&#39;s Secret Improv Club at The Secret Theatre in Long Island City and hopes to risk it to success. He is probably lurking on the DL in the last row of chairs at your indie show, furtive and alone; trying to &quot;keep up with the times&quot; like some dark-dwelling creep. 
Frank is a native of Queens, NY and so has no pity for anyone who has moved here out of free will, although he mostly loves the reasons why you are here.
