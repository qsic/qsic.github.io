        <p>
          Emily Bryan is a comedian, artist, and photographer from Upstate NY. As a comedian, she has been performing stand up, sketch, and improv for over ten years in Dublin, Boston, and New York City. She has written for and performed in over a hundred shows. Her current performance roster includes: Jungle! Jungle!, Miracle Baby, Bryan * Linsky, The Administration (coming soon!), and a remake of The Paul Lynde Halloween Special. She is also the creator of and a performer in Focus: an improvised parody of The View. In order to improve her comedic talents, Emily has studied with Armando Diaz, Rachel Hamilton, Tara Copeland, Stuart Ranson, Jean Villepique, Peter Gwinn, Abbey Sher, Anthony King, Michael Delaney, Billy Merritt, Christina Gausas, John O&#39;Donnell, and Doug Moe. Workshops include: T.J. &amp; Dave, Mike Myers, and Charna Halpern.

She is good at what she does. Hire her. You won&#39;t be disappointed.
 In her spare time, Emily enjoys studying US history and is currently working on a blog about Presidents. She is also trying to write a novel. She doesn&#39;t know what it&#39;s about yet, but she&#39;s pretty sure it will most likely involve a time machine and Theodore Roosevelt.
