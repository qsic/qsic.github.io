        <h2>Stefan Wenger</h2>
        <p>
          Stefan Wenger has been telling tall tales most of his life, and now he gets to do it on stage.  With a background in performance poetry and singing, Stefan&#39;s been trained by the Magnet and is all about the musical improv nowadays, performing with Petting Zoo every week, and also co-hosting the Magnet Musical Mixer with the rest of Snake Eyes. He&#39;s a native New Yorker, his ethnic background is Amish/Mennonite and he&#39;s into yoga and energetic healing work and other stuff that&#39;s weirder still.
