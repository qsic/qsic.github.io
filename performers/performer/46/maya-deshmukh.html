        <h2>Maya Deshmukh</h2>
        <p>
          Maya Deshmukh has been studying improv in NYC since 2008. Hailing from the great state of New Jersey, she is very happy to no longer be bridge and tunnel. She has trained at the UCB and Magnet theaters, studying improv and musical improv with Bobby Moynihan, Sylvia Ozols, Porter Mason, Becky Drysdale, Frank Spitznagel, and Michael Martin among others. Maya can be seen performing musical improv with Happy Karaoke Fun Time! When she is not doing improv, working/not sleeping, or catching up on Real Housewives (of all cities), she is probably getting yelled at.
 Maya graduated from Rutgers University with a BA in Genetics and Anthropology, and received her DMD from UMDNJ-New Jersey Dental School.
