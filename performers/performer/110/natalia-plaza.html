        <p>
          Natalia is apart of the improv graduate program at the UCBT. She has been a stage actor since childhood and has played the lead in many film projects. Now she is concentrating on her comedy and acting career full time and quit her part time job as a registered dental hygienist bc her dentist boss sucked ass.
