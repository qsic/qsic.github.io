        <h2>Joe Leonardo</h2>
        <p>
          Joe Leonardo is a comedic actor living in New York City with an absurd amount of natural talents including writing ambidextrously, creating children’s southern folk music, and inventing breakfast sandwiches (one’s called the “Cardiac Arrest”).  In his spare time when he’s not reciting an unhealthy amount of Beatles trivia or giving truthiness facts about wildlife, he spends it honing his craft of improvisational and sketch comedy at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre and with his improv troupe, Sea Tea Improv. Joe writes and produces sketches with the his sketch groups, Crafts and Arts and Asylum Attic. Joe has logged many hours of training at the UCB Theatre, The People’s Improv Theater, Hartford Stage, and the “streets”, homie! He’s been featured on a majority of Connecticut TV stations, newspapers, and nationally on ESPN, Travel Channel, Anderson Cooper LIVE, and others. Joe also does commercial work and is a frequent guest on The Colin McEnroe Show on NPR. You can see him performing regularly in New York and Connecticut; for more information, please email joeleonardojr@gmail.com.
