        <h2>Emerald Catron</h2>
        <p>
          Emerald Catron hails from Kansas, which means she&#39;s really good at being bored.  During her college years she performed stand-up and sketch comedy, as well as writing and performing in weekly serialized comedy stage productions.  She also taught children&#39;s theater for a while.  To counteract that, she formed a horrifically crude rap band in Philadelphia, Dem ShortyBooz.  Now she lives in New York City, studies at the People&#39;s Improv Theater, and hops onstage whenever she can.  Sometimes it&#39;s a great way to make a few extra bucks.
