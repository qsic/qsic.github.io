        <h2>Alex Bedirian</h2>
        <p>
          Alex moved to New York in November of 2010 after living in a one room cabin in the woods of Maine for two years. Not being one to take the easy road, he opted out of a life of alcoholism and depression that comes with being a Mainer and set his eyes on comedy in the big city. Since arriving he has studied with the Upright Citizens Brigade, reaching and taking their 501 or Advanced level classes. Alex holds an undergraduate degree in theater from the California University of Pennsylvania. All success he achieves are for the boys back north and any failures he blames on the government.
