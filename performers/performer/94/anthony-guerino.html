        <h2>Anthony Guerino</h2>
        <p>
          Anthony&#39;s been gettin&#39; knee deep in &#39;provin @ UCB and all around the biggest apple ever documented for a good long whiles. He fancies himself a layer of goofbricks, a kind of chuckle mason whose pleasure is derived not so much in the magnificent goof edifices whose erections he takes part in, but the beauteous process of puttin em together. He loves his buddies too, and is prone to crackin&#39; beers open with them and in their presence as a consecration of affection when he&#39;s not involved in high-speed high-five contests. (Two time finalist, national high five quintathalon)
