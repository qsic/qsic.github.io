        <h2>Brett White</h2>
        <p>
          Brett White has been studying improv and sketch comedy at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre since October 2006. His past improv instructors have included Ari Voukydis, Shannon O&#39;Neill, Joe Wengert, Michael Delaney, Chris Gethard, Porter Mason and Zach Woods. He has studied sketch under Chris Kula, Liz Cackowski and Neil Casey. He can be seen performing around New York City with the indie improv groups Bad Data, Iron Ruckus and Daddy. Brett was also part of the UCB 600 class ImproVérité: The Documentary.
 Brett interned at The Late Show with David Letterman in the fall of 2006 and appeared on-air in a sketch with Letterman himself. He brings this up often, as evidenced by this bio. He&#39;s also a freelance writer for Wizard Magazine, where he puts his ridiculous comic book knowledge to good use. Sketches from his college television show Fo&#39; Show can be found on YouTube, as well as the two Star Wars movies he made on his 15th birthday. He played Han Solo and wore a Hawaiian shirt.
