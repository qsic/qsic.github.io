        <h2>Brendan Jordan</h2>
        <p>
          An internet legend claims Brendan Jordan was &quot;born in a barrel-full of butcher knives and raised on knuckle sandwiches.&quot; The truth, however, is that Brendan grew up, the fifth of six children, on the mean streets of Bay Shore - Brightwaters, Long Island. His parents intentionally let the family&#39;s country club membership lapse when he was only 5 years old.
 A bit later, for a number of years, Brendan did a bunch of things which seemed to have kept him busy, but which he can&#39;t really recall in great detail, unless prompted during conversation over a few friendly drinks. A quick Google search shows he spent the early aughts designing concert posters for bands of various Rock &amp; Roll persuasions, including Quasi &amp; Ween. He once pretended to be Elliott Smith in front of the man himself, for purposes you&#39;ll have to find out on your own.
 In 2010, Brendan began studying improv &amp; sketch at The Magnet Theater, where he&#39;s been instructed by their exceptional faculty, including the very popular Megan Gray, Alex Marino, Rick Andrews, Russ Armstrong, Louis Kornfeld, Peter McNerney, &amp; Armando Diaz. Brendan has also studied independently under Michael Delaney, Will Hines, Christina Gausas, &amp; Scott Adsit.
 Mr. Jordan resides in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.
 So there.
